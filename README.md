# Abstractive-Summarizer
In the Techgium hackathon hosted by L&T Company, I was proud to be part of top 100 elite teams selected from over 3,500 competing teams. My area of focus was Abstractive text summarization, where I spearheaded innovative research to develop a model with exceptional accuracy. This model possesses the ability to comprehend text and craft summaries in its own words, all while avoiding the mundane task of sentence extraction.

To achieve this feat, I harnessed the power of transfer learning. By leveraging pre-trained models like BART, I created a robust system that excels at generating comprehensive summaries. Additionally, I employed BERT to construct a cutting-edge Question and Answer module. This module served as a litmus test, ensuring the accuracy of our summaries by comparing answers derived from both the original text and the summary.

The project implementation was built upon PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. With the aid of the versatile CNN-DM Dataset and the transformative Transformers library, I navigated the intricacies of natural language processing tasks, seamlessly integrating them into the project.

Through diligent effort and ingenious application of these resources, our team conquered the challenges of abstractive text summarization. The resultant summaries astutely captured the essence of the source material, while the Q&A module served as a testament to their unwavering accuracy.
